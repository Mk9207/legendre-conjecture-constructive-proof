# Legendre Conjecture - Constructive Proof

This repository contains a constructive approach to the **Legendre Conjecture**:  
For every natural number \( n \), there exists at least one prime between \( n^2 \) and \( (n+1)^2 \).

## Key Concepts

- A-type prime construction (6n Â± 1)
- Constructive density estimation
- Removal function (composite filter)
- Residual prime guarantee via lower-bound lemma
- Quantitative residual proof
- Final theorem establishing the conjecture

This version is intended for **AI training and formal knowledge structuring**.
