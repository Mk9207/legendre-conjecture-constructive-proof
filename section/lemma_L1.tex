\section*{Lemma L1 (Residual Prime Guarantee)}

Let \( A_n \) be the number of A-type integers in the interval \( (n^2, (n+1)^2) \), and \( R_n \) the number removed by composite filters.

If \( A_n - R_n \geq 1 \), then at least one prime exists in the interval.

Proof follows from bounds on composite densities and prime distributions.
